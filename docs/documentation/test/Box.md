# Box



> An upgradable storage box for a string.

The storage box can store a single string value, emit an event and also retrieve the stored value.

*Event emitted on storing the value.*

## Methods

### VERSION

```solidity
function VERSION() external view returns (string)
```






#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | undefined |

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize() external nonpayable
```

An initializer instead of a constructor.

*Compared to a constructor, an init adds deployment cost (as constructor code is executed but not deployed).      However when used in conjunction with a proxy, the init means the contract can be upgraded.*


### owner

```solidity
function owner() external view returns (address)
```



*Returns the address of the current owner.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### proxiableUUID

```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view returns (bytes32)
```



*Implementation of the ERC1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the implementation. It is used to validate that the this implementation remains valid after an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### renounceOwnership

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() external nonpayable
```



*Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call `onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner. NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.*


### store

```solidity
function store(string boxValue) external nonpayable
```

Permits the owner to store a value.

*storing the value causes the Store event to be emitted, overwriting any previously stored value.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| boxValue | string | value for storage in the Box, no restrictions. |

### transferOwnership

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external nonpayable
```



*Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`). Can only be called by the current owner.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newOwner | address | undefined |

### upgradeTo

```solidity
function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external nonpayable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |

### upgradeToAndCall

```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes data) external payable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`, and subsequently execute the function call encoded in `data`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |
| data | bytes | undefined |

### value

```solidity
function value() external view returns (string)
```

retrieves the stored value.

*the Box stores only a single value.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | store value, which could be uninitialized. |

```





#### Parameters
